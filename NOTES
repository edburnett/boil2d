Refactor player movement, rotation etc code into reusable generic functions
suitable for different games.

Possibly use vectors graphics instead of bitmaps and size them against a 
ratio of the window size.

Add a Game or App class which the main functions, loop reside in. This way
we can inherit things from this base class like the window, globally-required
objects, physics world, etc., rather than having to pass pointers all around. 
See GQE structure. Main app class has a run() member which is the main()
function and game loop.

Create another state class layer for Level or Gameplay. Expand upon that to
subdivide into levels, planets, rooms, etc.

Implement rest of debug draw functions. Fix colors so that they make sense
and have transparency to see objects underneath. Match colors of box2d 
testbed? Allow runtime toggling of the individual draw functions.
