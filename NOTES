add a Game or App class which the main functions, loop reside in. This way
we can inherit things from this base class like the window, globally-required
objects, physics world, etc., rather than having to pass pointers all around. 
See GQE structure. Main app class has a run() member which is the main()
function and game loop.

Create another state class layer for Level or Gameplay. Expand upon that to
subdivide into levels, planets, rooms, etc.

Implement rest of debug draw functions.
