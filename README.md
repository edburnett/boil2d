boil2d
======
Aims to become a basic template/framework for creating custom 2D game engines
in C++. Wrap libraries such as SFML and Box2D, and provide classes for a
finite state machine, fixed timestep game loop w/variable FPS and interpolation,
input handling, etc.

An evolving/experimental work in progress; testing & learning only at this
point.
